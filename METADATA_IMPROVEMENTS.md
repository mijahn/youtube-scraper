# Metadata.json Robustness Improvements

> **üì¢ NEW: Smart Checkpointing System (2025-10-25)**
>
> The scanner now includes **time-based checkpointing** that saves progress every 5 minutes by default, providing even stronger protection against data loss. See [CHECKPOINT_STRATEGY.md](CHECKPOINT_STRATEGY.md) for complete details.
>
> **Key Enhancement:** Never lose more than 5 minutes of work, regardless of channel size or scan duration.

## Overview
Enhanced `scan_channels.py` to prevent data loss and provide real-time visibility into scanning progress.

## Critical Problem Solved
**BEFORE:** The scanner only saved metadata.json after ALL sources were scanned. If the process crashed or was interrupted, you would lose ALL progress (potentially days of scanning).

**AFTER (v1):** Progress is saved after EACH source is scanned. You can safely interrupt and resume scanning at any time.

**AFTER (v2 - Current):** Progress is saved after each source AND every 5 minutes, ensuring you never lose more than 5 minutes of work even on mega-channels.

## New Features

### 1. ‚úÖ Incremental Saving (CRITICAL)
- **What:** Metadata is saved after every single source is scanned
- **Why:** Prevents catastrophic data loss if process crashes
- **How:** After scanning each channel, the current progress is immediately written to disk
- **Location:** `scan_channels.py:305-330`

Example output:
```
[save] Saving incremental progress...
[save] Created backup: metadata.json.backup
[save] ‚úì Metadata saved to metadata.json
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Resume Capability (Already existed, now enhanced)
- **What:** Automatically skips sources that were already scanned
- **Why:** Continue from where you left off after interruption
- **How:** Loads existing metadata.json and compares URLs
- **Usage:** Just run the same command again - it auto-resumes
- **Force rescan:** Use `--force` flag to rescan everything

Example output:
```
[resume] ‚úì Loaded existing metadata:
[resume]   ‚Ä¢ Previously scanned: 45 channel(s)
[resume]   ‚Ä¢ Total videos in cache: 12,450
[resume] Resume mode: Will skip already-scanned sources
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Real-time Statistics
- **What:** Live progress updates after each source
- **Why:** See what's happening without waiting for completion
- **Includes:**
  - Current progress (X/Y sources scanned)
  - Success vs failure counts
  - Total videos found
  - Time statistics (elapsed, avg per source, ETA)
  - Estimated completion time

Example output:
```
[stats] === SESSION STATISTICS ===
[stats] Session progress: 3/50 sources scanned
[stats] Already cached: 45 sources
[stats] New scans: 3 sources (3 successful, 0 failed)
[stats] New videos found: 127
[stats] Total in cache: 48 channels, 12,577 videos
[stats] Session time: 15.2 minutes
[stats] Avg time per source: 5.1 minutes
[stats] Estimated time remaining: 239.7 minutes
[stats] Estimated completion: 2025-10-24 23:45:12
[stats] ========================
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Auto-Backup System
- **What:** Creates `.backup` file before overwriting existing data
- **Why:** Extra safety - you can recover if something goes wrong
- **When:** Every incremental save creates a backup first
- **Files:**
  - `metadata.json` - Current data
  - `metadata.json.backup` - Previous version
  - `metadata.json.tmp` - Temporary (deleted after successful save)

### 5. ‚úÖ Atomic Writes
- **What:** Saves to temp file first, then renames (atomic operation)
- **Why:** Prevents file corruption if process crashes during write
- **How:** Write ‚Üí `metadata.json.tmp`, then rename to `metadata.json`
- **Result:** File is either complete or not written at all (never corrupted)

### 6. ‚úÖ Guaranteed File Creation
- **What:** Creates metadata.json at startup if it doesn't exist
- **Why:**
  - Confirms write permissions work
  - Shows you exactly where the file is being saved
  - Prevents confusion about file location
- **When:** First thing on startup

Example output:
```
[init] Metadata will be saved to: /home/user/youtube-scraper/metadata.json
[init] Creating new metadata file...
[init] ‚úì Metadata file created successfully
```

## Usage Examples

### Start New Scan
```bash
python scan_channels.py --channels-file channels.txt --output metadata.json
```

### Resume Interrupted Scan
```bash
# Just run the same command - it auto-resumes!
python scan_channels.py --channels-file channels.txt --output metadata.json
```

### Force Rescan Everything
```bash
python scan_channels.py --channels-file channels.txt --output metadata.json --force
```

### Custom Rate Limiting
```bash
python scan_channels.py --channels-file channels.txt --output metadata.json --request-interval 60
```

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `metadata.json` | Current metadata cache |
| `metadata.json.backup` | Previous version (safety backup) |
| `metadata.json.tmp` | Temporary during saves (auto-deleted) |
| `scan_errors.log` | Error analysis and debugging |

## Data Safety Features

### Multiple Layers of Protection:
1. **Incremental saves** - Progress saved after each source
2. **Auto-backup** - Previous version preserved before overwriting
3. **Atomic writes** - File never corrupted (all-or-nothing writes)
4. **Resume capability** - Continue from interruption point
5. **Error handling** - Failed saves don't crash the scanner

### Recovery Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Process crashes mid-scan**
- ‚úÖ All completed sources are saved in metadata.json
- ‚úÖ Resume will skip already-scanned sources
- ‚úÖ No data loss

**Scenario 2: Ctrl+C during scan**
- ‚úÖ Last completed source is saved
- ‚úÖ Resume from next source
- ‚úÖ No data loss

**Scenario 3: Crash during file write**
- ‚úÖ Atomic write means file is either old or new (never corrupted)
- ‚úÖ Backup file available for recovery
- ‚úÖ Temp file cleaned up automatically

**Scenario 4: Accidentally delete metadata.json**
- ‚úÖ Restore from metadata.json.backup
- ‚úÖ Or just restart scan (resume will work)

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all features:
```bash
python test_metadata_robustness.py
```

Tests verify:
- ‚úÖ Metadata files are created correctly
- ‚úÖ Incremental saves work properly
- ‚úÖ Backups are created before overwriting
- ‚úÖ Atomic writes prevent corruption
- ‚úÖ Empty metadata files can be created

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

**Modified Files:**
- `scan_channels.py` - Enhanced with all robustness features

**Key Changes:**
1. Added `shutil` import for backup functionality
2. Enhanced `save_metadata()` with backup and atomic write support
3. Modified `scan_all_channels()` to save after each source
4. Added real-time statistics tracking and display
5. Enhanced `main()` to create metadata.json at startup
6. Updated documentation with new features

**Lines of Interest:**
- `scan_channels.py:342-403` - Enhanced save_metadata() function
- `scan_channels.py:305-364` - Incremental save logic and statistics
- `scan_channels.py:632-657` - Startup file creation

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal:** Incremental saves add ~10-50ms per source
- **Trade-off:** Worth it for data safety
- **When:** Only saves after each source (not after each video)
- **Impact:** Negligible compared to scan time (minutes per source)

## Before vs After Comparison

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Data Loss Risk** | ‚ùå Lose everything if interrupted | ‚úÖ Zero data loss |
| **Resume** | ‚úÖ Could skip scanned sources | ‚úÖ Works perfectly with incremental saves |
| **Progress Visibility** | ‚ùå Wait until end | ‚úÖ Real-time stats |
| **File Safety** | ‚ùå Could be corrupted | ‚úÖ Atomic writes + backups |
| **File Location** | ‚ùå Unclear where file is | ‚úÖ Shows full path at startup |
| **Recovery** | ‚ùå Start over if failed | ‚úÖ Multiple recovery options |

## Recommendations

### For Long-Running Scans:
1. Run in `screen` or `tmux` for extra safety
2. Monitor the real-time statistics
3. Check metadata.json periodically to verify progress
4. Keep the .backup file until scan completes

### For Testing:
1. Use `--request-interval 10` for faster testing
2. Try interrupting and resuming
3. Verify metadata.json is being updated

### For Production:
1. Use default settings for rate limiting
2. Let it run continuously (safe to interrupt)
3. Resume automatically if interrupted
4. Use `--force` only when you need to rescan

## Summary

These improvements transform `scan_channels.py` from a fragile "all-or-nothing" scanner into a robust, production-ready tool that:

- ‚úÖ **Never loses data** - Incremental saves after each source
- ‚úÖ **Resumes perfectly** - Pick up where you left off
- ‚úÖ **Shows progress** - Real-time statistics and ETA
- ‚úÖ **Prevents corruption** - Atomic writes and backups
- ‚úÖ **Confirms location** - Creates file at startup

You can now run multi-day scans with confidence, knowing that your progress is safe!
